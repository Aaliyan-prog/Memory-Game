# Memory Game

Welcome to the Memory Game repository! This project is a simple, interactive browser-based memory matching game. The goal of the game is to test and improve your memory by matching pairs of cards that are randomly shuffled.

## Features:
Card Matching: Flip over cards to find matching pairs.
Randomized Layout: Each game session randomizes the card layout for a unique experience every time.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your score based on how quickly you match all pairs.

## How to Play:
1. Click on any card to flip it over.
2. Try to match it with another card by flipping another card.
3. If the two cards match, they will remain face-up. If they don't match, they will flip back.
4. Continue flipping cards until all pairs are matched.
